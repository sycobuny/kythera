# This is the configuration. Edit from here down.
#
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
#
# This file is, strictly speaking, a Ruby script. We've provided
# methods that allow the configuration to be simple and human-readable.
# Anything that works in Ruby will technically work here, but we
# suggest sticking with the basics unless you know what you're doing.
#
# Unquoted strings are interpreted as Ruby statements. Numbers do not
# need to be encapsulated within quotes. If your string is basic alphanumeric
# you can use a :symbol (prefixing your string with a colon instead of
# encapsulting it with quotations) as it is less noisy.
#
# The `use` statements are an extensibility feature. They allow you to
# pull an arbitrary Ruby module's methods into the main configuration
# parser so that you can provide configuration options for extensions.
# If you plan to do this check out the parser in `lib/kythera.rb` first.
#

# The actual configuration begins here
configure do
    use Kythera::Configuration # The base configuration options

    # This section of the configuration is dedicated to the general
    # behavior of the service as a whole.
    #
    daemon do
        # The name of our server
        name 'services.int'

        # The server description (seen in /LINKS)
        description 'kythera irc services'

        # The nickname and email address of the person running this service.
        admin :rakaur, 'rakaur@malkier.net'

        # How much logging should we do?
        # In order of least verbose to most verbose:
        # none, fatal, error, warning, info, debug
        #
        logging :info

        # The number of seconds between uplink connection attempts.
        reconnect_time 10

        # Should we verify an email address when we come across it?

        # The full path to your mail transfer agent.
        # This is used for things like email verification, etc.
